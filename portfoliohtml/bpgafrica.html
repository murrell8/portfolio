        BPG: Africa Village Builder is an orthographic, 2D game where you manage 
        a village by gathering resources and building new buildings. It has been 
        in ongoing development for multiple years, and it is used in parts of Africa 
        to teach young children important life skills like resource management, 
        teamwork, and more. Specifically, this game helps with Malaria and HIV-related 
        neurocognitive deficits. It is played primarily on iPads, though it is also functional 
        on Mac and Windows.

        This was the first project I began working on at the Michigan State 
        University GEL Lab (Games for Entertainment and Learning). This was 
        a pre-existing project that was being added to as new feature concepts 
        arose. I worked with a team of ten people to create new systems and 
        integrate them into the pre-existing game.

        The largest addition we made to the game was incorporating a hierarchy of
        needs into the systems in place. I added notifications for the player 
        to see when they needed to perform certain actions. I also added extra 
        information into a few systems to provide the player more understandable 
        feedback. Further, I worked with the designers on the structure we decided 
        to use for our hierarchy of needs, including adding new buildings into 
        the game and limiting the player's responsibilities depending on their level.
