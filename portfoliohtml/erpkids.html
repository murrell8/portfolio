            ERP Kids: Wildlife Conservation is an orthographic, 2D game for iOS 
            and Android. You play as a wildlife ranger who is setting up a new 
            reservation for elephants and rhinos. This game is meant to educate young 
            kids on the essential work of wildlife rangers, as well as the importance 
            of protecting wildlife. It incorporates real ranger tasks through minigames and live 
            footage of various animals in their natural habitats.

            This project was what I worked on for my Computer Science capstone. 
            My group worked with Evolutio to create this game for Elephants Rhinos 
            and People (ERP). My main contributions included drawing and integrating 
            animations, working on player movement, creating multiple functioning 
            minigames, drawing environment art, presenting my weekly progress to the 
            client, and putting together my team's final project video.

            This game was developed for mobile play, so my team made sure to 
            make it functional on Android and iOS devices. Further, we ensured 
            it would scale to different screen sizes properly so it would be playable 
            on tablets. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond creating a great game that had enjoyable mechanics, we wanted 
            our game to be educational. We made sure to incorporate real ranger 
            tasks into the game in a way that would be understandable for kids.

            Finally, my team was awarded Best Project Video by the professors and 
            Design Day judges.
