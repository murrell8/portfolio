        The Underbrush is a 2D adventure-puzzle game where you play as a 
        young child searching for cryptids while out camping with their father. 
        The player has to manage their inventory and make sure they aren't in the 
        dark for too long without a torch while searching for clues as to the 
        whereabouts of the cryptids. This game was developed with help from Blizzard.

        My most recent project was The Underbrush, which I worked on in a group of eight students 
        as my capstone project. We were given the wonderful opportunity of working with Blizzard 
        throughout the semester. I was a programmer on this project, but I also assisted with 
        design, art, and some production.

        My main contributions on this project included an inventory system, an interaction 
        system, functioning location-specific minimaps, and a light/dark system. 
        Throughout the semester, I continued to refine and adjust these aspects 
        of the game as our gameplay ideas evolved and we received player 
        feedback. I also helped design the level and assisted with the mechanic designs. 
        I even did some 2D environment art, as our game was quite art-heavy and the artists 
        were overwhelmed with work.
