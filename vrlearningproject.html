        Due to non-disclosure agreements and the project still being in progress, I cannot share the details of the project itself or the client. However, I can share the kind 
        of work I was engaged in while working on this project and the skills I developed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        While working on this project, I developed in Unity using C#. I developed code to function both on desktop builds and in a VR environment. I used various Unity packages, as well 
        as external packages such as Bearded Ninja Games's VR Interaction Framework, Michsky's Modern UI pack, and a few others. I created systems that accessed data on our server to 
        allow users to sign-in, select what set of assets they wished to load, and load said assets. These included things such as audio clips, images, and 3D interactable objects. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout the course of this project, I worked with a team of 5-10 people. These team members included other Unity developers, web developers, server developers, and artists. 
        Further, I often led meetings when the project lead was out, collecting status updates and communicating them to him. I was given the "Hit the Ground Running" award for my work 
        on this project, which was given to me for my immediate progress and success on the team. I worked on this project for the entirety of my time at METECS, totalling in a little 
        over one full year.
