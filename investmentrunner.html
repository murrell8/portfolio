        Investment Runner is an endless runner where you play as 
        a stock broker in the wild west. You use the runner portion of the game 
        to progress time and allow the stock market to move, then enter towns 
        to sell shares, work with clients, upgrade your stock options, and more. 
        This game was developed for the Michigan State University Federal Credit Union 
        as an edutainment game for late high school and early college students to 
        learn how the stock market functions. This game was developed to work for 
        both mobile and PC.

        Investment Runner was the first game I worked on at the GEL lab from start 
        to finish. Because I worked on this from the beginning, I programmed a lot 
        of systems that would become the groundwork for the game. I worked with a team 
        of ten people to produce this game.

        My largest contributions on this project included a stock market simulation (using 
        real stock patterns and placing points based on probability), a client system that 
        involved adjusting expected profits, acceptable loss, and initial budget based on 
        who the player was working with, touch screen control integration, and a shop system. 
        I also assisted with other things, such as character customization, player movement, 
        and general bug fixing.
