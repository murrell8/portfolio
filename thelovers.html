        The Lovers is a 2D puzzle game that all occurs within the pages of 
        a book. The players interact with animated sketches and narrative challenges 
        to break the curses cast upon the main characters. Different objects 
        on the page can be used to affect the rest of the items, such as enlarging 
        things with a magnifying glass or cutting branches with a large blade. 
        The game has unique puzzle mechanics and beautiful hand-drawn art!

        The Lovers was my first semester-long class project. I worked in 
        a group of eight people, where I was primarily an artist. Though most of 
        my focus was 2D art, I did help with some programming. Specifically, I 
        programmed UI elements within the pause menu, such as menu navigation 
        and a fully functioning sound menu. I also helped to assess the accessibility 
        of the game throughout the semester, and my group ended up having both 
        on-screen text and voice acting to make our game enjoyable for people 
        who are hard of hearing or visually impaired.
